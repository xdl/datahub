# Snowflake

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[snowflake]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)
- Table lineage.

:::tip

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for Snowflake using the `snowflake-usage` source described below.

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: snowflake
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: account_name
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass
    role: "accountadmin"

sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

## Compatibility

Table lineage requires Snowflake's [Access History](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history.html) feature.

## Snowflake Usage Stats

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

### Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[snowflake-usage]'`.

### Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Statistics on queries issued and tables and columns accessed (excludes views)
- Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity

Note: the user/role must have access to the account usage table. The "accountadmin" role has this by default, and other roles can be [granted this permission](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles).

Note: the underlying access history views that we use are only available in Snowflake's enterprise edition or higher.

:::note

This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your Snowflake warehouse, ingest using the `snowflake` source described above.

### Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: snowflake-usage
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: account_name
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass
    role: "sysadmin"

    # Options
    top_n_queries: 10

sink:
  # sink configs
```

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.
